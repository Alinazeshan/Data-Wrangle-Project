# Data Wrangle Project (Twitter data and Twitter API)

## Introduction

Using Python and its libraries, I gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. 
Wrangling efforts are documented in Jupyter Notebook, Then Showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

Data wrangling, which consists of:
Gathering data
Assessing data
Cleaning data

## Datset

The dataset used for wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. 
The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent."
WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

## What Software Do I Need?

- Jupyter Notebook
- The following packages (libraries) need to be installed:
.pandas
.NumPy
.requests
.tweepy
.json

## Goal of Project

Wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. 
The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information.
Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for "Wow!"-worthy analyses and visualizations.

## The Data
Three sources are used 
1. Enhanced Twitter Archive
2. Additional Data via the Twitter API
3. Image Predictions File

## Storing, Analyzing, and Visualizing Data for this Project

Stored the clean DataFrame(s) in a CSV file with the main one named twitter_archive_master.csv.
Additionally, you may store the cleaned data in a SQLite database (which is to be submitted as well if you do).

Analyze and visualize wrangled data in your wrangle_act.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.

## Reporting for this Project

Written report called wrangle_report.pdf or wrangle_report.html was created that briefly describes wrangling efforts. This is to be framed as an internal document.

A 250-word-minimum written report called act_report.pdf or act_report.html wass created that communicates the insights and displays the visualization(s) produced from wrangled data. This is to be framed as an external document, like a blog post or magazine article, for example.
